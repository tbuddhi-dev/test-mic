                        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 30): IJM Corp Bhd’s net profit for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2023 (2QFY2024) surged over threefold to RM93.69 million from RM27.03 million a year earlier, carried by strong showings from its property development and infrastructure segments. Earnings per share climbed to 2.67 sen from 0.77 sen, according to the group’s bourse filing on Thursday (Nov 30). Touching on the group’s topline, quarterly revenue jumped 36.05% to RM1.46 billion versus RM1.07 billion previously on the back of improvements across all its segments — comprising construction, property development, manufacturing and quarrying, infrastructure, as well as investment and others. IJM declared a first interim dividend of two sen per share, with a Dec 15 ex-date, to be paid on Dec 18. Most notably, IJM’s construction segment posted a 54.9% increase in revenue to RM416.15 million versus RM268.6 million previously, but profit before tax (PBT) dropped 37.3% to RM15.28 million from RM24.36 million previously as ongoing projects’ profit margins were negatively impacted by material and commodity price increase and prolongation cost, while new projects undertaken have yet to reach profit recognition. Despite this, IJM’s property development and infrastructure segments carried the group’s improvement in profitability. The group’s property development segment’s revenue increased 42% to RM463.7 million from RM326.55 million a year earlier on higher level of work progress achieved for ongoing developments as well as sale of two parcels of industrial land in Bandar Rimbayu. The property development segment’s PBT increased 159.7% to RM76.18 million from RM29.33 million previously due to the higher revenue and profit margin derived from current portfolio mix of ongoing project and the aforesaid industrial land sale. Meanwhile, the group’s infrastructure segment reported an 11.6% rise in revenue to RM242.36 million from RM217.15 million previously on higher port revenue arising from recovery of cargo throughput and higher ship revenue. The segment swung to a PBT of RM53.75 million versus a loss before tax of RM16.61 million on higher contributions from its port business and lower forex losses. For the six-month period ended Sept 30, 2023 (1HFY2024), IJM’s net profit rose 221.55% to RM194.33 million from RM60.44 million a year earlier, as revenue increased 25.16% to RM2.68 billion versus RM2.14 billion previously. Looking forward, IJM chief executive officer and managing director Lee Chun Fai said that with the improving macroeconomy and pick-up in construction activities, the group is well positioned to drive its growth agenda of growing its existing businesses, developing a portfolio in adjacent businesses and expanding its geographical footprint. “IJM’s balance sheet, with a net gearing of 0.27 times, is expected to bolster the group’s credentials to undertake large-scale projects and strategic investments,” he said in a statement on Thursday. According to the statement, the group’s construction order book replenishment prospects are encouraging and are supported by its outstanding order book of RM6.4 billion, which includes three recently secured construction contracts worth RM1.7 billion in the quarter under review. “The property division (property development segment) maintains its commitment to offering compelling products, carefully tailored to align with market preferences across diverse price points. With unbilled sales of about RM2.5 billion and its ongoing efforts in introducing attractive packages with right product pricing, the property division is expected to deliver a strong performance in the near term,” the group said on its property development segment. Touching on its infrastructure segment, IJM said its toll operations are expected to perform better in the current year (FY2024) with the absence of higher maintenance, such as resurfacing costs incurred in the previous year (FY2023). “In line with the tariff increase which commenced in April 1, 2023 and the recovery of cargo throughput experienced in 1HFY2024, the group’s Kuantan Port operation is expected to deliver a better performance in the short term,” it added. Shares in IJM ended five sen or 2.69% lower at RM1.81, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM6.6 billion. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

                        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: IJM Land Bhd will broaden its product offering and build more mixed-use integrated complexes with commercial assets in key cities to expand its investment portfolio for recurring income. The developer seeks to diversify its risk away from pure residential development projects for sale and into recurring income assets following two years of a home market downturn triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak. IJM Land is seeking to build additional investment buildings like office towers, hotels, malls, and convention centres, as well as wellness and medical facilities with assisted living, which can produce more steady recurring revenue than selling residential units. It also plans to build industrial parks as well as undertake transit-oriented developments (TOD) and autonomous rail transit-related (ART) projects. \"There is the ART with hydrogens in Sarawak. That is most likely one of the options we will consider. We are looking for potential TOD sites along the Mass Rapid Transit Line 3 (MRT3). I'm here to expedite development at IJM Land,\" its chief operating officer Datuk Tony Ling Thou Lung said. \"I studied the mandate I was given, which was to drive the company's strategic mission. We've been strategising what our short, medium and long-term goals should be. We are developing a variety of items that will hit the market during the next five years,\" Ling told the New Straits Times. IJM Land has been concentrating on township developments like Rimbayu and Seremban 2, which are primarily residential-based. Both townships will take another 10 years to finish. The company is also developing two large mixed-use integrated developments, The Light City in Penang and Pantai Sentral Park (PSP) in Kuala Lumpur, which will take 10–15 years to complete. It is looking to expand into the commercial segment of the property market, not just for recurring income but also to increase the gross development value (GDV) of its projects. \"The property development market is now demonstrating resilience to market changes. Yes, some of the developers were affected by the pandemic, but they are all recovering. As far as IJM Land is concerned, all our launches are doing very well. \"The bread and butter for IJM Land previously was township developments, but now we are moving into integrated developments with serviced apartments and retail because of diverse demographic changes and rapid urbanisation where people are looking for well-designed and sustainable homes. I am very optimistic about the future,\" Ling said. IJM Land achieved its highest local sales of RM2.7 billion in the financial year ended March 31, 2023 (FY2023), surpassing its previous record of RM2.5 billion in the year before that. The company has set a sales target of RM2.1 billion for FY2024. Although there is a lower sales target, IJM Land expects to perform better in FY2024, backed by RM3 billion in healthy unbilled sales as of March 31, 2023. This year, the company plans to launch nine new residential projects totaling RM2.1 billion in gross develo",

By continuing browsing this website, you are giving consent towards the same. •3 Nov 2023 Kuala Lumpur– OCBC Bank (Malaysia) Berhad (OCBC Bank) and IJM Land Berhad (IJM Land) have embarked on a strategic tie-up to promote sustainable living through a green home ownership programme that rewards purchasers for their ESG orientation. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed at a ceremony today attended by representatives from both parties. The collaboration sets out to both encourage and enable prospective homebuyers to make environmentally conscious decisions by purchasing or investing in green-certified properties developed by IJM Land while reducing their carbon footprint and ownership costs. OCBC Bank’s role, as the first foreign bank to collaborate with IJM Land in their holistic approach to green residential properties, is to offer financing packages that reward sustainable practices. The OCBC Green Home Financing scheme is designed uniquely for purchasers of IJM Land’s eco-friendly homes and offers them competitive financing rates and fast turnaround upon approval. According to Datuk Wong Tuck Wai, Chief Executive Officer of IJM Land, the developer places eco-friendliness and sustainability at the forefront of its designs and concepts, and not merely as a future aspiration but a present-day imperative. “In our continuing efforts to incorporate all our developments with sustainable design, it is now mandatory for every IJM Land’s residential project to be green-certified. At the core of our commitment to sustainability is achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, an ideal that is shared by our home financing partner, OCBC Bank. This commitment drives us to concrete actions, underpinned by a strong sense of purpose and drive to enrich the lives of current and future IJM Land property residents. “The collaboration empowers individuals and families to choose sustainability by providing favourable financing rates for our green properties. With this, OCBC Bank and IJM Land are jointly enabling green homeownership, setting a transformative example that will benefit and lead the way for the property and financial sector at large.  As part of the agreement, IJM Land will collaborate closely with OCBC Bank to expand their efforts in promoting sustainable living for our green-certified properties. “Our shared goal is to ignite inspiration and provide unwavering support to homeowners on their personal sustainability journey through important and impactful green initiatives. It centres on ecologically responsive homes that have a positive impact on both occupant and environment,” he said. Speaking for OCBC Bank, its Head of Consumer Financial Services Ms Anne Leh said the tie-up with one of the top developers in Malaysia enables the bank to reach out even further to those seeking a sustainable home financing scheme that rewards them for doing good. “We believe this synergistic collaboration will help to shape the industry for a more sustainable future. Along with the competitive rates being offered through our OCBC Home Financing scheme, we have placed on the table, until the end of January next year, the added incentive of a cashback programme that rewards customers for embracing environmental sustainability. “This complements OCBC Bank’s other existing offers on IJM Land’s sustainably designed properties across the Klang Valley, Penang, Negeri Sembilan, Johor, Sabah and Sarawak,” she said. IJM Land recently launched its “Make A Difference” (MAD) campaign to promote sustainability through its “Say Yes to 4R” initiative. This supports its core principles of reducing, repairing, reusing, and recycling across all IJM Land projects and townships. Prospective homeowners can participate in the MAD campaign until 31 December 2023 through a series of immersive eco-centric events organised with the aim of collecting over 40,000kg of recyclables. The entire IJM community is also mobilised to take 40 million collective healthy steps to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. The commitment to green stewardship extends to the distribution of 4,000 plants to nurture a greener future.

After a two-year absence to curb the pandemic, the celebration is set to take place on 4 February 2023 at IJM Seremban 2’s very own flagship development, Seremban 2’s City Park. Hosted by IJM Land, this year’s festival will be jointly organised by ASTRO to give locals a large-scale yet jovial celebration. Along with other programs, visitors can witness a lineup of cultural performances as well as various Instagrammable spots throughout the 15-acre landscape with the appealing theme of Seremban 2 Wonderland for everyone to capture memorable moments. Mr Chai Kian Soon, Senior General Manager of IJM Land Berhad shared that the property developer has been committed to providing its residents with a memorable Chap Goh Mei celebration since 2014. Despite the challenges faced which have resulted in putting the celebration on hold for a few years, IJM Land is persistent in bringing back the spirit of togetherness to reunite the multi-racial community once again. “Our multi-racial community has always been a priority for us, and events like this let us gather everyone under one roof to socialise and connect with one another. Additionally, it's a way for us to express our gratitude to our residents for their ongoing support over the years and to foster closeness within the neighbourhood,” said Mr Chai. Setting off at 7.00pm, visitors will be dazzled by an Illusion Magic Show as the opening performance, followed by a 24 Seasons Drum performance by Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Chan Wa. Continuing the long-standing Chinese tradition, visitors can also participate in a game of Chinese riddles and there will also be a special meet-and-greet session with this year’s official mascot, the Rabbit, with special giveaways to look out for. Not only that, the first 800 visitors will receive a festive gift at the redemption counter as a token of appreciation for their participation. IJM Land's Chap Goh Mei celebration wouldn't be complete without some celebrated fanfare. Once again, IJM Land will be collaborating with renowned ASTRO talents and celebrities including Vivienne Oon, Phei Yong, Jie Ying and many more to grace the town with a special themed concert, “Wang Tu GOLD”, before culminating the event with a dazzling fireworks display at 11.00pm. “The Chap Goh Mei celebration has consistently drawn a variety of crowds, and we take tremendous joy in brightening up the town where visitors can have great times with friends and family. This tradition has become an annual commitment from IJM Land to its community and we hope to carry this on for years to come,” said Mr Chai. In addition to providing a festive atmosphere in honour of the Chinese Valentine, IJM Land will also introduce its community recycling programme, the KITARecycle Programme in collaboration with SWM Environment at the SWM Environment booth to raise awareness of the importance of protecting the environment, at the same time encouraging the community to cultivate good recycling habits for a greener tomorrow.

Interest rate high people can sleep in the streets ah? They also need a house to stay mah!! Wake up call for what? Go and burn your own a55 lah! High interest rate will result in high repayment or longer period of housing loan. Even though, ppl need a place to stay but the problem is.. who can afford to buy such of high property’s  price. Think twice lah…. Looking at it’s location, high potential it’ll become Inti students hostel in future : ) Hi james, u cant afford a house cost 600k to 700k but doenst mean others cant afford…still alot rich guy u never meet or known For a 600k-700k house, monthly installment is only about RM3000++. Husband+wife share out, it’s only RM1500++ each. Nowadays a lot of working couples with total household income of more than 10K, and these are still not rich people. So you dont have to be rich to buy this, just upper mid class will be sufficient. I think it’s near the Chinese graveyard? You can see it from the main road. see the google maps u will knowloh….leasehold land… Leasehold left how many years? The design looks horrible, IJM is going from bad to worse @ChikoI agree its really ugly… looks like low cost housing in the 80-90s era… Buy Buy Buy before property price become higher and higher… did the architect design this during his toilet rush….? This is medium cost project, with such price what you expect on the design? You want premium design, you should pay premium price then can go buy gurney or tanjung bungah area. I see, so thats how IJM conducts its business, intentionally screw up the design for cheaper units to bait buyers into buying somethig more expensive. I have heard bad reviews about ijm before, but this is really low. @ABCthis look more like 300k apartment ….buyer now so easily appeased.. ?? no wonder your developer friend is laughing to the bank… All those saying negative comment are those who really want to buy this project. @Oh niceThis look like 300k apartment? You go and find see where 300k apartment look like this? Even flat design need 300k for this size without facility. You are still living in stone age? You need thanks the developer for building such decent size condo with such price. If I am the developer this project would cost min. 700k above as land price is penang island is skyrocket until need reclaimed land. @Mr.LeeTotally agreed. Those say negative was drooling for this project. @ABCha…never know that negative means interested…but then developer, “gurus” and property agent will sing praises to their project without fail…LOL anybody know how many car park given ? @sp2 side by side. It’s launching now..Any comments on this project? the project is not bad and better compared to 3 residences, the main concern is leasehod any comments? worth to buy or better look for nearby freehold project? Pros:+ Good package with rebates, interest subsidy, free MOT (limited unit).+ Some with 3 car parks.+ Nice unit layout. Much better than 3 Residences. Cons:– Too near and direct view of relau cemetery. A big NO for me.– Not so nice exterior appearance.– Leasehold. @IJM lover ya.. the package is attractive. the relau cemetery.. will be a distance from the building? @EVCemetery is very near. Just beside it. You can view it from google map. Those facing city view units will have direct cemetery view. The other consideration is hillview but still swimming pool is facing city view. Anyone has info on when the project will started ? Is the price still the same or will it give another 10% discount? @Interested buyerSame, they have some changes in package though. @JensenDo you know what are the changes on the package ? Any progress for this project ? When will be the expected completion ? Any Facebook or WhatsApp group for owners of this project? I’m interested for this project, any more details or comments to share about it?Those buyers can please share the packages you get it, any rebate? Hi, I’m interested to buy this property, can i have more details or comments about this property?The buyer can you please share the package u get, any rebate? Thanks. Hi, is there a chat group for the owners/residents of this property? Would like to join, if one exists. Hi, Did you get any chat group of this property Beware as certain units face cemetery directly Do you think the project is going to complete before Q1 2025? Every time I pass by, can see the progress is abit slow compared to those ideal’s projects.. hopefully the workmanship is good tho.. Can’t find more information related to the project, even people online is rarely discuss about it, i wonder where can we get further updates othe",

                "content": "CGS-CIMB Research has raised its target price (TP) for IJM Corp Bhd to RM2.88, from RM2.15, following higher forecasts of construction order book replenishments in the next three years, and property launches in 2024. Also adjusted were higher price-to-earnings multiples for the group’s construction and industrial building system (IBS), coupled with a narrower discount for its property business, which the research house maintained is “conservative”, reflecting project pipelines as well as IJM’s market position. It is “time to play catch up” with peer Gamuda Bhd, which the research house noted as having similar market capitalisation up until 2020, when Gamuda utilised its balance sheet to venture overseas. Comparatively, IJM’s balance sheet position with net gearing of 0.27 times will similarly “be handy” for future projects and acquisitions, the research house added. Shares in IJM had risen to RM2.22 at the time of writing on Tuesday, exceeding CGS-CIMB’s previous TP, valuing the group at RM7.57 billion. The counter has risen 18% since the start of the year, ahead of a 9.5% rise in the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index over the same period. At RM2.22, IJM was trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio (PER) of 27.7 times, against Gamuda’s (RM5.08) trailing PER of 16 times. Forward consensus PERs for the two companies are at 20.7 times for IJM and 13.9 times for Gamuda,Bloombergdata showed. CGS-CIMB has a TP of RM5.65 for Gamuda. The sustainable construction order book forecast for IJM was raised to RM7.5 billion, from RM4 billion previously. Its outstanding order book stood at RM6.5 billion as at end-September, CGS-CIMB said. Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB raised its estimate of IJM’s property launches for the financial year ending March 31, 2024 (FY2024) to RM2.8 billion, from RM2.5 billion previously. The segment is valued at a discount of 30%, from 40%, on its revalued net asset value. The research house is also “assuming stronger growth for [IJM’s] manufacturing business”, seeing consistent orders of one to two million tonnes per annum and resilient margins given the ability to pass on higher cost of raw materials. The price-earnings multiple for this segment has also been raised to 15 times, from 12 times. As for IJM’s 26% stake in listed highway concessionaire WCE Holdings Bhd, the valuation was updated to reflect its market value of RM192.8 million, CGS-CIMB said. “Potential new wins may come from the New Pantai Expressway extension of about RM1 billion, industrial warehouses and data centres leveraging the IBS plant in Bestari Jaya, in our view,” CGS-CIMB said. Other projects include Phase 2 of the Kuantan Port, the RM654 million Shah Alam International Logistics Hub, in which IJM is taking up a 25% stake, a RM260 million contract for the Kuching Urban Transportation System, as well as the RM175 million Kuala Lumpur International Airport aerotrain completion project, involving a venture between IJM and Pestech International Bhd. IJM is subscribing to a 44.8% equity stake in Pestech for RM124 million. The condition precedent deadline has been extended to Feb 24, 2024. “We believe investors should not overlook IJM, which has 1,080 acres (437.06 hectares) of industrial land in the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP) — 30% of its total land bank,” CGS-CIMB said. IJM in July 2022 sealed a partnership with China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) to develop an integrated mixed development and logistics hub on a 640-acre site in MCKIP 3. The earlier developments in MCKIP 1 and 2 are more mature and anchored by Alliance Steel, which is looking to double its capacity over the next two years, CGS-CIMB said. “We view CHEC’s participation positively, as it could bring more investments. By 2027, the MCKIP and Kuantan Port will be integrated with the East Coast Rail Link, which will benefit the MCKIP, and in turn IJM’s Kuantan Port, where throughput in the first half ended Sept 30, 2023 (1HFY2024) was 12.7 million tonnes (versus 22.7 million tonnes for FY2023). Rail projects in the pipeline include the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail, Mass Rapid Transit 3, and Penang Light Rail Transit 3, “given IJM's strong track record as evidenced by its step-in role for the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System”, CGS-CIMB added.

Quarterly revenue rose 36.1 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to RM1.46 billion compared to RM1.07 billion in the same period last year. This was due to higher contribution for the  construction division which reported a notable increase in revenue of 54.9 per cent to RM416.2 million. However, the division's pre-tax profit declined 37.3 per cent to RM15.3 million compared to the corresponding quarter last year, as profit margins on some ongoing projects were negatively impacted by increases in material and commodity prices, along with prolongation cost. Additionally, profit recognition on new projects undertaken is pending until a certain physical completion milestone is achieved. The property division reported higher revenue of RM463.7 million in Q2FY24, a 42.0 per cent increase from RM326.6 million registered in the corresponding quarter last year. This was mainly due to higher work progress in ongoing projects and the completion of the sale of two parcels of industrial land in Bandar Rimbayu. The industry division saw an increase in revenue of 21.9 per cent to RM316.0 million while revenue for the infrastructure division in the current quarter increased by 11.6 per cent to RM242.4 million. For the cumulative six months, the company's net profit rose to RM194.33 million versus RM60.44 million a year ago. Revenue for the period climbed 23.5 per cent YoY to RM2.68 billion from RM2.14 billion in the corresponding period last year. Chief executive officer and managing director Lee Chun Fai said with the improving macroeconomy and pick up in construction activities, the company is well placed to grow its existing business, developing a portfolio in adjacent businesses and expanding its geographical footprint. \"IJM's balance sheet, with a net gearing of 0.27 times, is expected to bolster the group's credentials to undertake large scale projects and strategic investments. \"The group's construction order book replenishment prospects are encouraging and is supported by its outstanding order book of RM6.4 billion, which includes three recently secured construction contracts worth RM1.7 billion in the quarter under review – Package 2A and Package 2B of the Immigration Customs and Quarantine Complex (ICQC) for the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link project, the ECRL Kuantan Port spur line and an ancillary building at an industrial property project in Kulim, Kedah,\" he said. He added the company's toll operations are expected to perform better in the current year with the absence of the higher maintenance, such as resurfacing costs incurred in the previous year. \"In line with the tariff increase which commenced on April 1, 2023 and the recovery of cargo throughput experienced in the first half of financial year 2024, the group's Kuantan Port operation is expected to deliver a better performance in the short term,\" he said.

                "content": "Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth, and if you're one of those dividend sleuths, you might be intrigued to know thatIJM Corporation Berhad(KLSE:IJM) is about to go ex-dividend in just two days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, IJM Corporation Berhad investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December. The company's next dividend payment will be RM0.02 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of RM0.08 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, IJM Corporation Berhad stock has a trailing yield of around 4.3% on the current share price of MYR1.87. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether IJM Corporation Berhad has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for IJM Corporation Berhad Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. IJM Corporation Berhad is paying out an acceptable 72% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 38% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously. Clickhere to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's not ideal to see IJM Corporation Berhad's earnings per share have been shrinking at 2.7% a year over the previous five years. Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. IJM Corporation Berhad has delivered 2.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops. Is IJM Corporation Berhad an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. Overall, it's hard to get excited about IJM Corporation Berhad from a dividend perspective. With that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with IJM Corporation Berhad, you should know about the other risks facing this business.

Renowned investor Warren Buffett has a lesser-known side that was revealed in his 2017 HBO documentary \"Becoming Warren Buffett.\" At age 93, Buffett is often seen as a wise figure dispensing life and investment advice. But the documentary sheds light on his youthful indiscretions, including an instance of shoplifting from Sears with friends. He also challenged his teachers by betting against their retirement stock.

                "content": "Stock Analysis Share IJM Corporation Berhad(KLSE:IJM) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 3 days.  The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend.  The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend.   Meaning, you will need to purchase IJM Corporation Berhad's shares before the 15th of December to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of December. The company's next dividend payment will be RM0.02 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of RM0.08 to shareholders.  Last year's total dividend payments show that IJM Corporation Berhad has a trailing yield of 4.3% on the current share price of MYR1.88.    Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid.  That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. Check out our latest analysis for IJM Corporation Berhad Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable.   IJM Corporation Berhad paid out more than half (72%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.     That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow.     Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 38% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously. Clickhere to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective.   If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously.     So we're not too excited that IJM Corporation Berhad's earnings are down 2.7% a year over the past five years. The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth.     IJM Corporation Berhad has delivered 2.1% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years.       That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever. Has IJM Corporation Berhad got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments?      The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future.        To summarise, IJM Corporation Berhad looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity. So if you want to do more digging on IJM Corporation Berhad, you'll find it worthwhile knowing the risks that this stock faces.

                "content": "Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) is said to be mulling on hiring a IJM Corp Bhd-led consortium to carry on with the aerotrain replacement project that was halted in August, according to sources familiar with the matter. Sources toldThe Edgethat MAHB is currently ironing out the details before issuing the letter of intent to the consortium for the resumption of upgrading of the automated people mover (APM) system. Besides IJM, the other two consortium members are said to be Pestech International Bhd and French rolling stock maker Alstom, both of which are the original contractors. It is worth noting that IJM Corp is in the midst of taking up a 44.83% stake in Pestech by injecting fresh capital of RM124 million by subscription to new shares at 15 sen apiece via a restricted offer. When contacted, MAHB said it is still in talks with parties involved, and hence cannot reveal details of the matter. Although the latest development offers a glimmer of hope that upgrading work will be resumed sooner than later, it remains uncertain whether passengers will get the aerotrain ride next July as per the original timeline. The three-year APM replacement project came with two deadlines originally, the first being July 2024 for the first of the two aerotrains to be operational, followed by the second one in March 2025 for full completion with both aerotrain services – spanning about 1.5 km — coming online. The 25-year-old aerotrain was suspended in March this year, after a major breakdown that resulted in 114 passengers being stranded midway on the track. This came midway of the replacement programme, which was awarded to Pestech in December 2021, with Alstom supplying the aerotrain. In August, MAHB decided to terminate Pestech, citing “non-performance, compromising significant project milestones and risking delays to deliver the project within the required deadline” as the reasons. “This project is of significant importance to ensure the comfort and convenience of our passengers travelling through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Our focus moving forward is on the timely delivery of the aerotrain while observing stringent quality control and safety standards of the project, with no compromise on our operations and governance processes,” said then managing director and group chief executive officer Datuk Seri Iskandar Mizal Mahmood. About two months later in October, MAHB announced that Iskandar Mizal’s tenure was not renewed and expired in the same month, with the board of directors naming group chief financial officer Mohamed Rastam Shahrom as the acting group CEO in the interim.

The dividend yield will be 4.3% based on this payment which is still above the industry average. See our latest analysis for IJM Corporation Berhad While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Before this announcement, IJM Corporation Berhad was paying out 72% of earnings, but a comparatively small 38% of free cash flows. Since the dividend is just paying out cash to shareholders, we care more about the cash payout ratio from which we can see plenty is being left over for reinvestment in the business. The next year is set to see EPS grow by 64.9%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 56% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward. While the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was MYR0.065, compared to the most recent full-year payment of MYR0.08. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 2.1% over that duration. Modest growth in the dividend is good to see, but we think this is offset by historical cuts to the payments. It is hard to live on a dividend income if the company's earnings are not consistent. With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. We are encouraged to see that IJM Corporation Berhad has grown earnings per share at 9.1% per year over the past five years. Recently, the company has been able to grow earnings at a decent rate, but with the payout ratio on the higher end we don't think the dividend has many prospects for growth. Overall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock. It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

In an email interview withCity & Country, YTL Land & Development executive director Yeoh Pei Teeng says Kwasa Damansara offers strong growth prospects for the company to tap into the resilient demand for urban housing. “In 2021, YTL Group confirmed its participation as a development partner of Kwasa Land Sdn Bhd (master developer of Kwasa Damansara) in the Kwasa Damansara township’s master plan. The opportunity to partner Kwasa Land presents an exciting undertaking with a shared vision to introduce sustainable integrated living based on the master plan’s core values of fostering a green, inclusive and connected township.” As Kwasa Damansara is one of the last available land bank of this size for township development within the Klang Valley, Yeoh anticipates strong demand for well-designed homes that are supported by transport links. “We are committed to the dynamic process of transforming the premium land bank into a thriving community by shaping urban landscapes into vibrant and functional spaces to meet the needs and aspirations of a new generation of homebuyers.” The low-density gated-and-guarded Dedaun Rimba was conceptualised to offer urban living in a lush, landscaped environment, drawing inspiration from the natural green surroundings of the site that was once plantation land. According to Yeoh, around 30% of the project has been designated for open spaces, exceeding the authority’s requirement of 10%. “We have conceptualised the project as a nature-inspired development incorporating key principles of sustainability into its design to bring sustainable benefits to both nature and residents.” With an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM200 million, Dedaun Rimba will comprise 264 units in total — 68 units of 3-storey link homes and 196 units of 1½-storey townhouses — spread across a 12.7-acre leasehold parcel. The development will also feature a 1.28-acre central park and landscaped spaces, including a 2.71-acre linear park, as well as a 3-storey residents-only clubhouse. Positioned around the central park, the 20ft by 70ft link homes have been designed with families in mind. They will have a 5-bedroom, 4-bathroom layout with a built-up of 2,462 sq ft. When in the living and dining areas on the ground floor, residents will enjoy uninterrupted views of the central park via the back sliding doors. Similarly, the master bedroom on the first floor and junior master bedroom on the second floor are also located at the rear to take advantage of the central park views. The link homes also come with a multifunctional room and an adjacent bathroom on the ground floor that can be transformed for multigenerational living or into a study. The townhouses will sit along the development’s perimeter and are connected to the linear park, which is linked to the central park via the overall green network of the development. With a land area of 22ft by 70ft, the townhouses comprise a lower unit measuring 1,397 sq ft in built-up, and an upper unit measuring 1,554 sq ft. The lower unit will have three bedrooms and three bathrooms, while the upper unit will have three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a powder room. For the lower unit, the living space is situated on the ground floor, featuring a living and dining area with a dry and wet kitchen as well as a bedroom that caters for multigenerational living needs. A master bedroom and another bedroom occupy the first floor. For the upper unit, the primary living space is located on the first floor — accessible via a staircase — and is designed as a double-volume area with large windows. For added privacy, the bedrooms are situated on the top floor, which also has study corner that overlooks the living area. The design offers homebuyers the flexibility of owning both units, allowing them to create a multigenerational home while maintaining a separate access for privacy and independence. The townhouses are priced from RM800,000 while the link homes are RM1.3 million onwards. Both will be sold unfurnished. Owners can expect to pay an estimated monthly maintenance fee of 28 sen psf, inclusive of the sinking fund. Residents will be able to park two cars within the link houses’ compound, whereas one tandem car park is allocated to each townhouse, says Yeoh. “More importantly, Dedaun Rimba is located within the proposed Kwasa Damansara transit-oriented development envisioned to connect the community to all parts of the Klang Valley via public infrastructure,” she adds. The link homes and townhouses are also designed to accommodate smart home automation devices and electric vehicle chargers. In addition to the parks, playgrounds and jogging track, residents will have access to clubhouse amenities such as a 25m infinity pool, wading pool, gymnasium, multipurpose hall, meeting room and kindergarten. Yeoh is confident Dedaun Rimba will be well received as she believes landed strata developments remain an attractive option for growing families, upgraders and young working adults who favour gated-and-guarded projects close to nature and that offer a welcome respite from the frenetic pace of urban living. “Our link houses will appeal to growing as well as multigenerational families seeking bigger homes or planning to upgrade from their existing landed homes in older but non-gated communities to a lifestyle-oriented community with 24-hour security. As for our townhouses, they will appeal to the younger demographic of working adults, upgraders, young families and an emerging group of empty nesters. “Wanting a better quality of life, we notice that homebuyers are moving towards new developments on the fringes of the city that are attractively priced and supported by ready public infrastructure,” she adds. Dedaun Rimba is served by two MRT lines — Sungai Buloh-Kajang and Putrajaya — and is within walking distance of two stations, namely Kwasa Sentral (500m) and Kwasa Damansara (800m). Surrounded by the mature suburbs of Petaling Jaya, Subang and Shah Alam, the development is connected to multiple highways such as the Damansara-Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH), New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), Damansara Puchong Expressway (LDP) and the Sprint-Penchala Link. Says Yeoh, “The appeal of a gated-and-guarded development with an innovative concept like Dedaun Rimba will drive buying interest to Kwasa Damansara, which is envisioned to be the greenest, most connected and inclusive township in the Klang Valley.” In October, YTL Land previewed Danau Puchong. The three-acre high-rise development in Puchong consists of two blocks of 32-storey residential towers overlooking a lake. With a GDV of RM200 million, Danau Puchong comprises 428 units, of which 45% has been taken up. “Danau Puchong is a fresh take on lakeside living, which drew inspiration from a disused tin mining lake adjacent to the development site, following the successful launch of our Lake Edge development in the early 2000s,” says Yeoh. “The low-density development [of Danau Puchong] will be transformed into a vibrant lakeside community interwoven with verdant surroundings comprising lush greens and healthy lifestyle amenities to promote the health and well-being of residents.” Danau Puchong is slated to be completed by 3Q2027. Meanwhile, the company is looking to launch d2 in Sentul East, Kuala Lumpur, in 2Q2024. This commercial development project will feature contemporary architecture and design in the century-old historical railway town of Sentul that has been rejuvenated and transformed into a vibrant neighbourhood in line with YTL Land’s overarching Sentul Masterplan. Located on a freehold parcel in Jalan Sentul, d2 is a low-density development comprising 338 small office/home office (SoHo) units and 13 retail units at street level. “The SoHo concept will cater to the inherent demand for trendy and flexible live-in workspaces by a new generation of young workers, entrepreneurial business owners and start-ups. Leveraging on Sentul’s strategic location and accessibility in the city, the project boasts convenient connections to LRT, MRT and KTM stations,” Yeoh shares. She adds that the company’s new projects will continue to raise the bar on nurturing nature to thrive and blend into the development by making use of biophilic design. “In this instance, d2 will challenge the norms of stereotypical commercial buildings, both in terms of design and usage of space as well as the embrace of natural greenery in its interior, connecting and shared spaces. “Demand for lifestyle developments focused on greenery and lush landscapes has been trending for years even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has reinforced this trend for safe and comfortable spaces amid verdant greens to enhance the everyday experience of living, working and learning. We expect to see more developments embracing nature-centric philosophy as building designs evolve to incorporate the principles of biophilic architecture,” Yeoh says.

There was also a higher fair value gain on properties worth RM68.05 million within the portfolio, it said. There are 15 properties across Malaysia, Japan, and Australia that make up the portfolio, which is presently valued at RM4.825 billion. YTL REIT said as a result of better performance and a higher fair value gain, it net profit surged to RM141.22 million in FY2023 from RM83.87 million a year ago. Revenue in FY2023 increased to RM486.83 million from RM363.86 million previously, while net property income was higher at RM251.27 million versus RM214.82 million before. YTL REIT told the stock exchange yesterday that income available for distribution in the fiscal year increased 78.79 per cent to RM126.86 million compared with RM70.96 million in the preceding year.   It said that the performance of the Australian portfolio comprising Sydney Harbour Marriott, Brisbane Marriott and Melbourne Marriott improved during the reviewed year as a result of Australia's international borders reopening in early 2022, which increased demand from the corporate and leisure markets. Both average daily room rates and average occupancy rates increased across the portfolio, it said. Correspondingly, revenue and net property income for the year under review increased by 17.78 per cent and 21.63 per cent, respectively, while the increase for the fiscal year was 65.53 per cent and 74.24 per cent, respectively. The property segment from the Malaysian and Japanese properties (Hilton Niseko Village and The Green Leaf Niseko Village) normalised the rental on July 1, 2022, after the rental deferral programme ended on June 30, 2022. \"In addition, the first rental difference was billed at the end of June 2023 pursuant to the same programme. Revenue and net property income approximated those of the preceding year's corresponding quarter and the preceding year, except that the revenue for the year under review comprised mostly of realised rental income,\" it said. Moving forward, YTL REIT said that with the opening of international borders, the hospitality industry is expected to stay relatively buoyant amid the risk of higher inflation, interest rate hikes, and other economic challenges. \"Notwithstanding the short-term challenges, the group remains confident of the long-term prospects of the hospitality secto",

                "content": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growingreturnon capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasingamountof capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note,YTL Corporation Berhad(KLSE:YTL) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for YTL Corporation Berhad, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.087 = RM5.9b ÷ (RM80b - RM12b)(Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023). Thus,YTL Corporation Berhad has an ROCE of 8.7%.In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Integrated Utilities industry average of 5.0%. Check out our latest analysis for YTL Corporation Berhad In the above chart we have measured YTL Corporation Berhad's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out ourfreereport for YTL Corporation Berhad. YTL Corporation Berhad has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 123% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking. To bring it all together, YTL Corporation Berhad has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And a remarkable 126% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if YTL Corporation Berhad can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead. YTL Corporation Berhad does come with some risks though, we found3 warning signs in our investment analysis,and 2 of those are a bit unpleasant... While YTL Corporation Berhad may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity. Check out thisfreelist here.

If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities.

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in ourfreereport on analyst forecasts for the company. YTL Corporation Berhad's ROCE growth is quite impressive.   Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 123% over the last  five years.  So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments.  It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking. To sum it up, YTL Corporation Berhad is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive.      And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last  five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors.   Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

                "content": "Dashveenjit Kaur @DashveenjitK dashveen@hybrid.co The CEO of Nvidia had just concluded his visits around Asia, focusing specifically on Southeast Asia.Photo: Tengku Zafrul’s X. When Jensen Huang established Nvidia three decades ago, his vision was to turn his passion into a thriving industry. He shared a foresight with his team, and they began shaping the future of computing, emphasizing the significance of accelerated, graphics-focused processing. Grounding their argument in the success of video game consoles thirty years ago, Nvidia has since transformed into the leading producer of microprocessorsdriving the AI revolutiontoday.   In 2013, Huang, as CEO and co-founder of Nvidia, made a strategic bet on AI, influenced by promising research from the academic computer science community, charting a course that would define the company’s future. The pivotal moment arrived in mid-2023, when it was disclosed that ChatGPT,the AI chatbot dominating headlinessince it went live in late 2022, had been trained on an Nvidia supercomputer. Subsequently, on May 25, 2023, with the Nasdaq opening, Nvidia’s market value skyrocketed by around two hundred billion dollars, propelling the chipmaker to breach a market cap of US$1 trillion a few days later. Described as the sole “arms dealer” in the ongoing AI war by a Wall Street analyst, today, Nvidia has become synonymous with AI dominance. “We now have AI that can understand data of many kinds: text, images, chemicals, proteins, and even the laws of physics. And it can generate content of many kinds,” Huang told reporters during a media roundtable session in Kuala Lumpur last week. Huang spent an hour with local reporters on his maiden trip to Malaysia. “I have the opportunity to meet your Prime Minister. And as you know, your Prime Minister is the only prime minister in the world with AI as his name, and I’m in the AI business. How can I refuse to meet the AI Prime Minister?” he said. (The Prime Minister’s name is Anwar Ibrahim – AI if abbreviated). When asked about the purpose of his trip to Malaysia as part of his Asian tour, Huang said he had taken the opportunity to visit many developers, startups, researchers, and young companies. “Second, as you know, Malaysia is an excellent infrastructure hub for Southeast Asia, with really terrific companies like YTL,” he added. As some unconfirmed reports suggested, Huang was asked if Nvidia and YTL are working together. But it wasn’t untilafterthe media briefing that the announcement came that confirmed YTL will advance AI development in Malaysia in collaboration with Nvidia. On November 8, 2023, Malaysian infrastructure conglomerate, YTL Power International Berhad (YTL), revealed its partnership with Nvidia to develop AI infrastructure, aiming to introduce thefastest supercomputersto Malaysia by mid-2024. The announcement was made during a meeting on Friday, attended by Huang and Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, along with other key figures. YTL is a company with a distinct legacy. “[Since computing infrastructure] requires access to land, facilities, and power, I think YTL could play a great role in that,” Huang told reporters before YTL announced later that day.

Unlike Singapore, the collaboration will give birth to Malaysia’s first supercomputer by Nvidia YTL, which will deploy Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs, which power today’s most advanced AI data centers, and use Nvidia AI Enterprise software to streamline production AI. “Nvidia AI Enterprise includes Nvidia NeMo, an end-to-end, cloud-native framework for building, customizing, and deploying generative AI models from anywhere,” Nvidia explained. YTL’s AI infrastructure, situated in the YTL Green Data Center Park in Kulai, Johor, a 500 MW facility powered by on-site solar energy, will be owned and managed by YTL Communications Sdn Bhd. The initial phase is expected to be operational by mid-2024. As a pioneer in mobile networks, YTL Communications, under its “Yes” brand, introduced 4G and 5G services in Malaysia. According to YTL, the AI infrastructure will support the development of scientific research applications and propel Malaysia toward becoming an AI-driven nation. “YTL not only offers energy-efficient AI infrastructure but also develops AI applications and services, leveraging Nvidia NeMo to create a customized Malay language foundation model reflecting Malaysia’s diverse heritage,” the company said. Clad in his signature look – a black leather jacket, often paired with a black T-shirt and black jeans, which he wears every time he is in the public eye – Huang spent an hour with local reporters during his maiden trip to Malaysia. Photo: Tech Wire Asia/TechHQ Throughout the roundtable, Huang iterated several times the possibility of Southeast Asia becominga vital technology hub. “[The region] is very good at many aspects of the technology supply chain and quite excellent in packaging and assembly as well battery manufacturing in particular,” Huang told reporters. In Malaysia particularly, the data center infrastructure, “a layer of computing which is one of the most important parts of AI and cloud, is very successful here,” Huang said. “I think we’re going to see Southeast Asia participate across the entire technology stack, and Malaysia play a role in cloud infrastructure,” he added. Huang also explained how the AI revolution has given birth toa new type of data center: the AI data center. “This type of data center is unlike the old one; it’s designed to produce while the previous kind was designed to hold data. That’s why it was called the data center. It was designed to hold all of our files and run applications,” he explained. The AI data centers, according to the tech titan, are “really factories.”   “It takes raw data and transforms it into real,valuabledata. That’s called artificial intelligence, a transformation that is basically like manufacturing,” Huang emphasized. Therefore, he believes Malaysia’s excellent manufacturing and Nvidia’s data center technology expertise could turn the country into a hub for AI manufacturing. The topic of China and itsgeopolitical tensions with the USfrequently arises wherever Huang is, given that the Eastern powerhouse accounts for approximately 20% of the US chip giant’s global revenue. At the Malaysian roundtable, Huang was asked about the unfortunate dynamics between the nations. “There’s no guarantee of success,” he said, “so we’ll do our best to succeed.” For context, the AI chip giant has commanded more than a90% share of China’s US$7 billion AI chip market. The initial impact of the October 2022 US restrictions targeted the company’s H100 and A100 AI chips, seeking to limit sales to China. In a September 2022 filing, Nvidia indicated that the US government had permitted the continued development of the H100 in China. But when Chinese companies shifted to using Nvidia’s H800 and A800 chips, made specifically for the Chinese market, they faced renewed restrictions on those sales imposed by the US in October this year. Nvidia CEO predicts Vietnam expansion and AGI. “The US has determined to regulate our technology,the highest end of our technology, and limit its access to China. The regulations specify the maximum performance we can ship to China, and we will follow the regulations precisely, and very explicitly do so,” Huang told reporters, adding that Nvidia is currently in the process ofcoming up with new chips for China. Reporters asked Huang about AGI–artificial general intelligence–which he defined as a piece of software or a computer that can complete tests that reflect basic intelligence that’s “fairly competitive” with that of an average human. “I believe we can achieve this. A general version perhaps in the next five to eight years,” he predicted. He explained that while machine learning excels in tasks like recognition and perception, it currently lacks the capability for multistep reasoning, a crucial focus for companies and researchers to achieve AGI, according to Huang. The CEO of Nvidia concluded his Southeast Asia visit with a stop in Vietnam, where he plans to create a hub to boost the country’s semiconductor industry, marking it as a crucial market. Although it was another of Huang’s inaugural visits, he expressed the company’s commitment to establishing a center in Vietnam, considering it as Nvidia’s home. “The base will be for attracting talent from around the world to contribute to the development of Vietnam’s semiconductor ecosystem and digitalization,” said the Vietnamese government, citing Huang after he met with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. Having previously invested US$250 million in Vietnam, Nvidia is scheduled to explore collaboration agreements on semiconductors with Vietnamese tech companies and authorities during a meeting today, as reported byReuterslast week.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. This means that investors who purchase YTL Corporation Berhad's shares on or after the 9th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 29th of November. The company's upcoming dividend is RM0.04 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of RM0.04 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, YTL Corporation Berhad stock has a trailing yield of around 2.6% on the current share price of MYR1.54. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. View our latest analysis for YTL Corporation Berhad If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. That's why it's good to see YTL Corporation Berhad paying out a modest 40% of its earnings. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. What's good is that dividends were well covered by free cash flow, with the company paying out 13% of its cash flow last year. It's positive to see that YTL Corporation Berhad's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut. Clickhere to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends. Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see YTL Corporation Berhad's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years. YTL Corporation Berhad is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend. Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. YTL Corporation Berhad has delivered an average of 7.2% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders. Should investors buy YTL Corporation Berhad for the upcoming dividend? It's great that YTL Corporation Berhad is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. It's disappointing to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, but as things stand now, the low payout ratio suggests a conservative approach to dividends, which we like. There's a lot to like about YTL Corporation Berhad, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it. So while YTL Corporation Berhad looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. To that end, you should learn about the2 warning signswe've spotted with YTL Corporation Berhad (including 1 which is concerning).
