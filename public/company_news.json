YTL Power International increased 31 sen to RM3.68, YTL Corporation added 12 sen to RM2.36 and Maybank rose six sen to RM9.06. These stocks lifted the composite index by a combined 7.53 points. At 5 pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 4.34 points to 1,487.34 from Thursday's close of 1,483.00. The benchmark index opened 0.24 of-a-point firmer at 1,483.24 this morning and hit an intraday low of 1,482.02 in the mid-morning session. In the broader market, gainers beat decliners 492 to 486, while 445 counters were unchanged, 796 untraded and 29 others suspended. Turnover declined to 4.08 billion units worth RM2.84 billion from 4.64 billion units worth RM3 billion on Thursday. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the United States (US) headline inflation came in hotter than expected, however, the supercore component, which the US Federal Reserve (Fed) closely watches, came in softer than expected. \"Hence, market-based rate cut expectations for March remain intact, with the US 10-year bond yields still trading sub-four per cent, which is ostensibly favourable for the local bourse,\" he told Bernama. Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said the key regional indices ended mostly lower as investors are cautious following the weak performance on Wall Street overnight. \"With the higher-than-expected US inflation in December, economists predict that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates in March, with many anticipating that the central bank will postpone such a move until its May meeting,\" he said. Among the other heavyweights, Petronas Chemicals rose four sen to RM6.92, Telekom Malaysia perked seven sen to RM5.82, while Sime Darby Plantation decreased 11 sen to RM4.31, and Tenaga Nasional lost 10 sen to RM10.34.

While the location of the SEZ has not been firmed, analysts said it is likely to be in the Iskandar Malaysia region. This would benefit companies with significant land bank in the state as well as construction and infrastructure players that could participate in the development of the SEZ. The SEZ is also poised to amplify the demand for office space in the coming years, amid the relocation of businesses, benefiting property developers and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In a media invitation, it was mentioned that the MoU signing ceremony for the SEZ will be held on Jan 11 in Johor Baru. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Singapore’s Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong are scheduled to ink the MoU. The event will be witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong. Bullish on the SEZ, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said the project would be “catalytic on many fronts”. It is expected to accelerate foreign direct investment momentum, especially by global multinational corporations who want to co-locate to both Singapore and Johor for strategic reasons. It will also spur new infrastructure developments to support the higher economic activities ahead. Maybank IB Research said in a note that potential beneficiaries of the SEZ would be sectors like property, construction, retail and utilities. It highlighted that listed property players with a presence in Johor, especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region, have gained considerably in 2023. “A developer with presence in Johor and which is in our existing ‘buy’ list is S P Setia Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd has one of the largest land bank in Iskandar Puteri besides Khazanah Nasional Bhd. “In addition, plantation players like Genting Plantations Bhd also have ongoing property developments in Johor. “Others property players with a presence in Johor are Sunway Bhd , IOI Properties Group Bhd , Scientex Bhd , Lagenda Properties Bhd , Kimlun Corp Bhd , KSL Holdings Bhd and Haily Group Bhd ,” it said. Maybank IB Research said the construction sector would also gain from an anticipated higher level of construction activities in Johor for infrastructure, industrial buildings, data centres and warehouses. Contractors with presence in Johor are Sunway Construction Group Bhd , Ekovest Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd , among others. In the retail sector, Maybank IB Research noted that a pedestrian overhead bridge to connect Komtar JBCC – an asset under Al-Salam REIT – to the upcoming Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Bukit Chagar Station – would be ready in 2027. This is expected to be the game changer to improve the outlook for Komtar JBCC mall. “And in the utilities sector, Ranhill Utilities Bhd is a direct beneficiary of higher economic activities due to its exclusivity in providing source-to-tap water in Johor. “ YTL Power International Bhd ’s 18.87% equity stake in Ranhill on Nov 3, 2023 and a further 2.9% indirect stake on Nov 24 – bringing its total effective interest to 20.9% – will draw considerable interest as to YTL Group’s plans for Ranhill,” stated Maybank IB Research.",

YTL Power International increased 31 sen to RM3.68, YTL Corporation added 12 sen to RM2.36 and Maybank rose six sen to RM9.06. These stocks lifted the composite index by a combined 7.53 points. At 5 pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 4.34 points to 1,487.34 from Thursday's close of 1,483.00. The benchmark index opened 0.24 of-a-point firmer at 1,483.24 this morning and hit an intraday low of 1,482.02 in the mid-morning session. In the broader market, gainers beat decliners 492 to 486, while 445 counters were unchanged, 796 untraded and 29 others suspended. Turnover declined to 4.08 billion units worth RM2.84 billion from 4.64 billion units worth RM3 billion on Thursday. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the United States (US) headline inflation came in hotter than expected, however, the supercore component, which the US Federal Reserve (Fed) closely watches, came in softer than expected. \"Hence, market-based rate cut expectations for March remain intact, with the US 10-year bond yields still trading sub-four per cent, which is ostensibly favourable for the local bourse,\" he told Bernama. Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said the key regional indices ended mostly lower as investors are cautious following the weak performance on Wall Street overnight. \"With the higher-than-expected US inflation in December, economists predict that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates in March, with many anticipating that the central bank will postpone such a move until its May meeting,\" he said. Among the other heavyweights, Petronas Chemicals rose four sen to RM6.92, Telekom Malaysia perked seven sen to RM5.82, while Sime Darby Plantation decreased 11 sen to RM4.31, and Tenaga Nasional lost 10 sen to RM10.34.

            "content": "PETALING JAYA: Stocks with exposure to Johor emerge on investors’ radar, as the governments of Malaysia and Singapore are set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) today. While the location of the SEZ has not been firmed, analysts said it is likely to be in the Iskandar Malaysia region. This would benefit companies with significant land bank in the state as well as construction and infrastructure players that could participate in the development of the SEZ. The SEZ is also poised to amplify the demand for office space in the coming years, amid the relocation of businesses, benefiting property developers and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In a media invitation, it was mentioned that the MoU signing ceremony for the SEZ will be held on Jan 11 in Johor Baru. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Singapore’s Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong are scheduled to ink the MoU. The event will be witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong. Bullish on the SEZ, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said the project would be “catalytic on many fronts”. It is expected to accelerate foreign direct investment momentum, especially by global multinational corporations who want to co-locate to both Singapore and Johor for strategic reasons. It will also spur new infrastructure developments to support the higher economic activities ahead. Maybank IB Research said in a note that potential beneficiaries of the SEZ would be sectors like property, construction, retail and utilities. It highlighted that listed property players with a presence in Johor, especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region, have gained considerably in 2023. “A developer with presence in Johor and which is in our existing ‘buy’ list is S P Setia Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd has one of the largest land bank in Iskandar Puteri besides Khazanah Nasional Bhd. “In addition, plantation players like Genting Plantations Bhd also have ongoing property developments in Johor. “Others property players with a presence in Johor are Sunway Bhd , IOI Properties Group Bhd , Scientex Bhd , Lagenda Properties Bhd , Kimlun Corp Bhd , KSL Holdings Bhd and Haily Group Bhd ,” it said. Maybank IB Research said the construction sector would also gain from an anticipated higher level of construction activities in Johor for infrastructure, industrial buildings, data centres and warehouses. Contractors with presence in Johor are Sunway Construction Group Bhd , Ekovest Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd , among others. In the retail sector, Maybank IB Research noted that a pedestrian overhead bridge to connect Komtar JBCC – an asset under Al-Salam REIT – to the upcoming Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Bukit Chagar Station – would be ready in 2027. This is expected to be the game changer to improve the outlook for Komtar JBCC mall. “And in the utilities sector, Ranhill Utilities Bhd is a direct beneficiary of higher economic activities due to its exclusivity in providing source-to-tap water in Johor. “ YTL Power International Bhd ’s 18.87% equity stake in Ranhill on Nov 3, 2023 and a further 2.9% indirect stake on Nov 24 – bringing its total effective interest to 20.9% – will draw considerable interest as to YTL Group’s plans for Ranhill,” stated Maybank IB Research.",

YTL Power International increased 31 sen to RM3.68, YTL Corporation added 12 sen to RM2.36 and Maybank rose six sen to RM9.06. These stocks lifted the composite index by a combined 7.53 points. At 5 pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 4.34 points to 1,487.34 from Thursday's close of 1,483.00.

Turnover declined to 4.08 billion units worth RM2.84 billion from 4.64 billion units worth RM3 billion on Thursday. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the United States (US) headline inflation came in hotter than expected, however, the supercore component, which the US Federal Reserve (Fed) closely watches, came in softer than expected. \"Hence, market-based rate cut expectations for March remain intact, with the US 10-year bond yields still trading sub-four per cent, which is ostensibly favourable for the local bourse,\" he told Bernama. Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said the key regional indices ended mostly lower as investors are cautious following the weak performance on Wall Street overnight. \"With the higher-than-expected US inflation in December, economists predict that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates in March, with many anticipating that the central bank will postpone such a move until its May meeting,\" he said.

While the location of the SEZ has not been firmed, analysts said it is likely to be in the Iskandar Malaysia region. This would benefit companies with significant land bank in the state as well as construction and infrastructure players that could participate in the development of the SEZ. The SEZ is also poised to amplify the demand for office space in the coming years, amid the relocation of businesses, benefiting property developers and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In a media invitation, it was mentioned that the MoU signing ceremony for the SEZ will be held on Jan 11 in Johor Baru. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Singapore’s Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong are scheduled to ink the MoU. The event will be witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong. Bullish on the SEZ, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said the project would be “catalytic on many fronts”. It is expected to accelerate foreign direct investment momentum, especially by global multinational corporations who want to co-locate to both Singapore and Johor for strategic reasons. It will also spur new infrastructure developments to support the higher economic activities ahead. Maybank IB Research said in a note that potential beneficiaries of the SEZ would be sectors like property, construction, retail and utilities. It highlighted that listed property players with a presence in Johor, especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region, have gained considerably in 2023. “A developer with presence in Johor and which is in our existing ‘buy’ list is S P Setia Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd has one of the largest land bank in Iskandar Puteri besides Khazanah Nasional Bhd. “In addition, plantation players like Genting Plantations Bhd also have ongoing property developments in Johor. “Others property players with a presence in Johor are Sunway Bhd , IOI Properties Group Bhd , Scientex Bhd , Lagenda Properties Bhd , Kimlun Corp Bhd , KSL Holdings Bhd and Haily Group Bhd ,” it said. Maybank IB Research said the construction sector would also gain from an anticipated higher level of construction activities in Johor for infrastructure, industrial buildings, data centres and warehouses. Contractors with presence in Johor are Sunway Construction Group Bhd , Ekovest Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd , among others. In the retail sector, Maybank IB Research noted that a pedestrian overhead bridge to connect Komtar JBCC – an asset under Al-Salam REIT – to the upcoming Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Bukit Chagar Station – would be ready in 2027. This is expected to be the game changer to improve the outlook for Komtar JBCC mall. “And in the utilities sector, Ranhill Utilities Bhd is a direct beneficiary of higher economic activities due to its exclusivity in providing source-to-tap water in Johor. “ YTL Power International Bhd ’s 18.87% equity stake in Ranhill on Nov 3, 2023 and a further 2.9% indirect stake on Nov 24 – bringing its total effective interest to 20.9% – will draw considerable interest as to YTL Group’s plans for Ranhill,” stated Maybank IB Research.",

YTL Power International increased 31 sen to RM3.68, YTL Corporation added 12 sen to RM2.36 and Maybank rose six sen to RM9.06. These stocks lifted the composite index by a combined 7.53 points. At 5 pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) rose 4.34 points to 1,487.34 from Thursday's close of 1,483.00. The benchmark index opened 0.24 of-a-point firmer at 1,483.24 this morning and hit an intraday low of 1,482.02 in the mid-morning session. In the broader market, gainers beat decliners 492 to 486, while 445 counters were unchanged, 796 untraded and 29 others suspended. Turnover declined to 4.08 billion units worth RM2.84 billion from 4.64 billion units worth RM3 billion on Thursday. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the United States (US) headline inflation came in hotter than expected, however, the supercore component, which the US Federal Reserve (Fed) closely watches, came in softer than expected. \"Hence, market-based rate cut expectations for March remain intact, with the US 10-year bond yields still trading sub-four per cent, which is ostensibly favourable for the local bourse,\" he told Bernama. Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said the key regional indices ended mostly lower as investors are cautious following the weak performance on Wall Street overnight. \"With the higher-than-expected US inflation in December, economists predict that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates in March, with many anticipating that the central bank will postpone such a move until its May meeting,\" he said. Among the other heavyweights, Petronas Chemicals rose four sen to RM6.92, Telekom Malaysia perked seven sen to RM5.82, while Sime Darby Plantation decreased 11 sen to RM4.31, and Tenaga Nasional lost 10 sen to RM10.34.

            "content": "PETALING JAYA: Stocks with exposure to Johor emerge on investors’ radar, as the governments of Malaysia and Singapore are set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (SEZ) today. While the location of the SEZ has not been firmed, analysts said it is likely to be in the Iskandar Malaysia region. This would benefit companies with significant land bank in the state as well as construction and infrastructure players that could participate in the development of the SEZ. The SEZ is also poised to amplify the demand for office space in the coming years, amid the relocation of businesses, benefiting property developers and real estate investment trusts (REITs). In a media invitation, it was mentioned that the MoU signing ceremony for the SEZ will be held on Jan 11 in Johor Baru. Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli and Singapore’s Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong are scheduled to ink the MoU. The event will be witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien Loong. Bullish on the SEZ, Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) Research said the project would be “catalytic on many fronts”. It is expected to accelerate foreign direct investment momentum, especially by global multinational corporations who want to co-locate to both Singapore and Johor for strategic reasons. It will also spur new infrastructure developments to support the higher economic activities ahead. Maybank IB Research said in a note that potential beneficiaries of the SEZ would be sectors like property, construction, retail and utilities. It highlighted that listed property players with a presence in Johor, especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region, have gained considerably in 2023. “A developer with presence in Johor and which is in our existing ‘buy’ list is S P Setia Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd has one of the largest land bank in Iskandar Puteri besides Khazanah Nasional Bhd. “In addition, plantation players like Genting Plantations Bhd also have ongoing property developments in Johor. “Others property players with a presence in Johor are Sunway Bhd , IOI Properties Group Bhd , Scientex Bhd , Lagenda Properties Bhd , Kimlun Corp Bhd , KSL Holdings Bhd and Haily Group Bhd ,” it said. Maybank IB Research said the construction sector would also gain from an anticipated higher level of construction activities in Johor for infrastructure, industrial buildings, data centres and warehouses. Contractors with presence in Johor are Sunway Construction Group Bhd , Ekovest Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd , among others. In the retail sector, Maybank IB Research noted that a pedestrian overhead bridge to connect Komtar JBCC – an asset under Al-Salam REIT – to the upcoming Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Bukit Chagar Station – would be ready in 2027. This is expected to be the game changer to improve the outlook for Komtar JBCC mall. “And in the utilities sector, Ranhill Utilities Bhd is a direct beneficiary of higher economic activities due to its exclusivity in providing source-to-tap water in Johor. “ YTL Power International Bhd ’s 18.87% equity stake in Ranhill on Nov 3, 2023 and a further 2.9% indirect stake on Nov 24 – bringing its total effective interest to 20.9% – will draw considerable interest as to YTL Group’s plans for Ranhill,” stated Maybank IB Research.",

Public Bank and Maybank added four sen each to RM4.40 and RM9.10 respectively. Both stocks lifted the composite index by a combined 2.07 points. At 12.30pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) gained 0.28 per cent or 4.23 points to 1,499.93 from yesterday's close of 1,495.70.

However, in the broader market, decliners beat gainers 500 to 429, while 454 counters were unchanged, 836 untraded and 19 suspended. Turnover amounted to 4.16 billion units worth RM2.08 billion. In a note today, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd said it expects profit-taking to emerge in the utility-related stocks as the sector has been rallying strongly over the past few days, while the other sectors that have room to grow may include consumer, transportation and logistics, technology as well as the industrial products. “We believe the building materials sector may benefit from the recent rally in construction and property sectors on the back of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail theme and the easing requirements of Malaysia My Second Home, while the heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East could lift the shipping industry,” it said. The brokerage firm said that traders will be monitoring the inflation data this week, namely the United States’s (US) December consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index to gauge the direction of the interest rates going forward.
